# Nice gourmet pizza

Recipe I use is from the Santa Barbara Baker. Makes around 3 16" pizza's or 4 15" pizza's. The key is to let the dough cold ferment in the fridge for 3 or 4 days after mixing.

Ingredients

• ⁠400 g "00" Flour I use "00" Normal from Central Milling. 11.5% protein (Caputo "00" Pizza Flour is 12.5% protein)
• ⁠400 g Bread Flour I use Artisan Bakers Craft+ Organic Bread flour from Central Milling. 11.5% protein. (King Arthur Bread Flour is 12.7%, if using KA, use King Arthur AP Flour 11.7% )
• ⁠50 g T85 Flour (or whole wheat mix, see video) I use T85 Flour or "Old World Bread Flour" (T80)
• ⁠25 g Salt I use kosher salt or sea salt.
• ⁠10 g Olive Oil I use California grown extra virgin olive oil.
• ⁠2 g Yeast\*\* \*\*I use Fleischmann’s Instant Yeast.
• ⁠555 g Water Filtered room temperature water. If it's especially warm out I'll make part ice to keep the temperature down.

Instructions

Mixing the Dough

• ⁠Add water to the mixer bowl. Add yeast and let absorb for about 1-minute. Mix on low to dissolve or just stir with to dissolve with your hand.
• ⁠Add flours to the mixer bowl. Using the dough hook mix on low speed just till no dry flour remains, about 1-minute. Cover and let rest in mixer bowl about 25 minutes.
• ⁠Add 25g salt to the mixer bowl and mix on low speed. After the salt is worked into the dough slowly add 10g extra virgin olive oil with mixer running. Mix about 3-4 minutes on low to medium. The dough should look mostly smooth.
• ⁠Re-weigh your dough to get your final dough ball size (divide total by 4 or 5 depending on desired pizza size, 4 for a 13-15in pizza 5 for 10-12in).
• ⁠Cover tightly. Let bulk ferment at room temperature for 30 minutes to 3 hours (actual time will depend on your environment it should almost double. Watch the video for more details)

Balling the pizza dough balls

• ⁠Lightly oil a half sheet pan or dough tray. (I place the dough ball(s) I plan to use the same day on their own sheet or plate)
• ⁠Lightly dust a work surface with flour. With floured hands remove the dough from the bowl.
• ⁠Lightly dust the top of the dough with flour.
• ⁠Using a scale as you go. Divide the dough into 4 -5 portions. (4 dough balls for 13-15 in. pizzas, 5 for 10-12 in.) I use a bench scrapper to cut the dough.
• ⁠Working with the dough in your hands form into balls, making sure to close. Watch the video to learn how.
• ⁠Place on half sheet pan or dough tray. Cover tightly. Let ferment at room temperature till dough balls are looking nice and perky with micro bubbles visible when looking at the surface of the dough. 30 minutes -4 hours, actual time depends on your environment.
• ⁠For cold fermentation, refrigerate dough balls for up to 5 days. For same day, use when ready or refrigerate till an hour before use to prevent over-proofing.

Tempering the Dough (about 1-hour before baking pizzas if dough has been cold fermented)

• ⁠Temper the dough by removing from the refrigerator and allowing to come to room temperature before using. You may carefully remove individual dough balls and temper on an oiled, covered plate reserving additional dough balls for later use
